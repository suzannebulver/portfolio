            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I create comprehensive technical documentation that explains complex concepts and procedures to meet the
                needs of developers, administrators, and other users. I've owned user guides, API documentation,
                release notes, error messages, and UI copy for AWS. I created documentation for some of the core AWS
                services including Amazon EC2 and AWS Auto Scaling. I also created documentation
                for Amazon EC2 Mac instances, Amazon Linux, AWS DataSync, and AWS Storage Gateway.

                <p>At AWS, I created user-facing documentation for cloud services. I collaborated with product, UX, and
                    engineering
                    teams to ensure content was accurate and met customer needs. After launches, I analyzed
                    documentation metrics and page
                    view data to improve the website content. I incorporated generative AI tools, such as Amazon Q, to
                    increase my productivity.

                <p>At Pellissippi State, I used my knowledge to explain complex math concepts to students in a way that
                    met their learning style.
                    I collaborated with other tutors and instructors to find different ways to help students understand
                    the concepts. I assisted students
                    with their online homework and explained how to use the software. </p>

                    <h4>EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML</h4>
                    <p>I collaborated with product and engineering teams to create the documentation for EC2 Capacity
                        Blocks. This was
                        a high profile project with an accelerated timeline which could not be allowed to slip. I worked
                        with designers on UI text strings, created and modified help panels,
                        and added descriptions for two new API operations. I created the documentation and broke it into
                        sections including
                        concepts, how it works, pricing and billing, procedures, monitoring, and logging. Content has
                        been added since the initial launch, but
                        I created the initial structure and documentation.

                    <h4>AWS Application Auto Scaling Predictive Scaling</h4>
                    <p>I created the documentation for the launch of predictive scaling for Application Auto Scaling.
                        Because of the integration between services, there needed to be a section about integration and
                        links to the integrated services user guide.
                        I also worked closely with the technical writers from the other services that initially were
                        integrated with predictive scaling.

                        Retrieve macOS AMI IDs, and macOS AMI release notes. For the Update operating system and
                        software section, I had to work
                        closely with the engineering team on the procedure because I could not spin up a Mac instance to
                        try out the procedure on my own as I would for other services.

                    <p>As part of an AWS departmental initiative to help customers find content specific to their use
                        case, I refactored the entire Auto Scaling User Guide to concepts, tasks, and troubleshooting
                        sections.
                        I also improved SEO by adding abstracts, keywords, and revising titles to a recommended length.
                        The metric to measure negative documentation feedback decreased by about 25% after the
                        refactoring.

                        submitting feedback that it was difficult to
                        find the information that they needed for Amazon Linux. I removed all of the Amazon Linux
                        content from the EC2 User Guide and moved it to a new Amazon Linux guide. I created a new
                        landing page and separated the Amazon Linux content into Amazon Linux 2023 and previous
                        generations of Amazon Linux.
